* Introduction
- We're now going to use everything you've learned so far to create a special page for your JavaScript badges.
- So you're focusing on the HTML and CSS, they have been provided for you.
- Download the HTML by [[file:~/Curriculum/7-WD-JS/resources/6_resources/Badges.html][/Right-Clicking here/]] and choosing to download the file.
- Download the CSS by [[file:~/Curriculum/7-WD-JS/resources/6_resources/css/badges.css][/Right-Clicking here/]] and choosing to download the file.

- The first thing to do is to create a directory structure to store your work.
- Make a directory called =Badge-Page=
- /Inside/ the =Badge-Page= directory, create one directory called =css=, another called =js= and one more called =badges=.
- Place the Badges.html into the main directory.
- Place the badges.css into the css directory.
- Place the badges you have been awarded so far into the badges directory.
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Open up Badges.html in a text editor.
- Have a good luck through the html.
- You'll notice that there is no css there at all, instead there is this line.
#+BEGIN_SRC html
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/badges.css">
#+END_SRC
- This line tells the web browser that all the css can be found on a seperate file.
- The file is called =badges.css= and is located in the =css= directory.
- This is a much neater way of creating web pages. First it tidies up your html and secondly it makes sure that lots of different pages can all access the same css file.
- Let's do the same for out JavaScript, and put it all in a seperate file.
- Add this line to your html, jest below the link to the css.
#+BEGIN_SRC html
        <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="js/badges.js"></script>
#+END_SRC
- This tells the browser that all the JavaScript can be found in the =js= directory and is called =badges.js=
** Save It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: save
:END:
- Save the file.
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- Run the file in the browser.
- Nothing much should be displayed at the moment, so let's fix that.
** Try It:
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END
- At the moment there is a div in your HTML with the id =badges1=
- Inside this div are some =<img>= tags that don't really link to anything at the moment.
- Change the =<img>= tags so that they point to the badges you have earned while learning JavaScript. You should have 5 in total by now.
- Make sure the page looks okay in a browser.
* Creating a badges.js file
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Open up your web pages in a browser and then open the developers console.
- You shoudl see an error message, along the lines that the javascript file can't be found.
- Let's fix that now.
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- In your text editor save a blank file as =badges.js= in the =js= directory you created earlier.
- 
** Save It
