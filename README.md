# Computing Module Structure README

##Introduction

The purpose of this structure is to provide a way for teachers to produce modules for teaching KS3 Computing in a consistent manner.

This means that theoretically different teachers at different schools can work on their own modules but then advertise that module on somewhere like the Computing at School forums.

Therefore if a teacher is new to Computing and struggling to find decent modules or if a teacher wants to see if a topic is already covered they can check CaS and download a module or write something else to fill a gap.

Please submit change ideas to the structure!  I would like to tailor it as much as possible.  There is also an ideas document [here](https://github.com/sharland/ComputingModule/blob/master/dev_ideas.md) for future development of this structure.

##How to use

I suggest downloading the module structure as a zip and using it as part of your own folder structure or repositories.

##Module Structure

This structure is obviously not set in stone but following as much of it as possible will enable other teachers to pick up what they need to do.

An empty template is also [available here](https://github.com/sharland/ComputingModule/blob/master/module_template.md)

###Title

Include a simple title.

###Target year group or age

Decide on who you think who this module would best be aimed at whether it's an age range or a specific year.

###Purpose of Module

Give an introductory description of the purpose of the module.  This should describe the broad aims and objectives of this module.

###Knowledge and Skills

In this section describe what sort of knowledge and skills pupils are going to cover.  This will hopefully give pupils an ida of what they should be acquiring by the end of the module.

###Cross-Curricula links

Does your project have any cross-curricula links to other subjects?

###Progression from this module

Once a pupil has completed the module - what could they go onto next?

###Example work

For certain modules it might be useful to add an example of work which pupils will be aiming for.

###Glossary

A list of terms and definitions relevant to the module.

###Self-assessment questions

Self-assessment questions, such as **'What was I most successful with in this module?'** are useful for pupil reflection.  List the questions you will ask as part of this module.

###Theory Questions

List the theory questions you would like to ask as part of this module.  The purpose of these will be to check whether pupils have gained the understanding required of them for the module.

###Work-criteria check-list

These questions will be useful for checking that pupils have completed certain work related tasks such as 'Have you included an IF ELSE block as part of your scratch animation?'

###Homework

If you wish to set homework for this module either include a general description here or in each specific lesson.

###DfE Computing Curriculum mapping

How does this module map to the [DfE Computing Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)?

###CaS Progression Pathways mapping

How does this module map to the [CaS Progression Pathways](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/1692) developed by Mark Dorling?

###Lessons

Use the separate lesson template to design each of the lessons in the module and then link to them from here.

A lesson template is available [here](https://github.com/sharland/ComputingModule/blob/master/lesson_template.md)

###Resources

List all of the website resources and other software and hardware which pupils might need.
